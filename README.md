# SIM-CE

SIM-CE is an advanced, user-friendly modeling and simulation environment in Simulink, for performing multi-scale behavioral analysis of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. 
elegans). 

Detailed description of the SIM-CE platform is avaible at the main.pdf file. A shorter version is also available (WBC_ICML2017.pdf file). 

Files, include Simulink implementation of the tap-withdrawal neural circuit (NewTapWithdrawalCircuit.slx) of the C. elegans, Deterministic (TwoNeuronTest.slx) and stochastic (PicturePicture.slx) models of a neuron.
